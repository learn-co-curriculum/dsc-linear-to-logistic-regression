# Linear to Logistic regression

## Introduction

In this lesson, you'll be introduced to the logistic regression model. You'll start with an introductory example using linear regression, which you've seen before, to act as a segue into logistic regression. After that, you'll learn about the formal notation of logistic regression models. Then, you'll conclude this lesson by looking at a real-world example.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Describe the need for logistic regression
* Interpret the parameters of a logistic regression model
